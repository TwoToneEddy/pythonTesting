1.3:

The histogram shows the distribution in the data is not even, the majority of the masses are < 500, The distribution is not normal. There are some cases of much higher masses
which raise the mean so in this case the median may be a better average to use.

1.4:

Changes to the requirements of the class:
1:  Auto bin sizing of the histogram depending on the dataset
2:  Add methods to add other fields from the data to the histogram to visualise correlation between
the mass and other variables, eg, x and y position
